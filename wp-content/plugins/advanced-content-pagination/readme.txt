**Usage:**

* After activation just go to Edit/Add Post page.
* Then select a part of content/text you'd like to split as a new subPage and click on ACP button icon ( black "[>]" icon is located next to other TinyMCE button icons.)
* On the popup window you'll see a field for pagination button title, just insert a text and click on [insert] button. This wraps your selected content in ACP shortcode like this:
`[nextpage title="pagination button title here"]
subPage content here...
[/nextpage]`
* You can also add this shortcode manually without using ACP button icon and popup window.


**In Dashboard**

Click on the "AP Pagination" menu and manage pagination settings. Here you can manage: 

* Turn on/of ACP pagination buttons
* Change pagination buttons layout and style 
* Change pagination buttons location (top/bottom/both)
* Make pagination carousel's navigation buttons fixed
* Change content loading type (ajax, refresh)
* Other settings...
