== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How can I change an embedded Tweet's background and link colors to match my site's theme? =

The Twitter plugin for WordPress includes a settings page with options to customize the background color, link color, and border color used in Twitter embedded Tweets and embedded timelines.

= How do I include an embedded timeline in my page? =

Log in to Twitter.com and visit the [Twitter widgets settings page](https://twitter.com/settings/widgets) to create and manage [embedded timeline](https://dev.twitter.com/web/embedded-timelines) widgets for your account. Widget settings are saved to a widget identifier for the logged in account; you may want to create a widget from your site's account, not your personal account, for continuity and general organization.

Copy-and-paste the HTML generated by the Twitter widgets configuration tool into a new [WordPress text widget](http://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress_Widgets#Using_Text_Widgets).

= My custom link color and border color do not appear in embedded Tweets or timelines =

Your site may have a [Content Security Policy](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/Security/CSP/Introducing_Content_Security_Policy) blocking Twitter's JavaScript from inserting your custom styling into the widget.

You may have configured an embedded timeline widget with a non-default link color. Your widget configuration overrides your page / theme configuration.

= Does the Twitter plugin add additional tracking of my site's visitors? =

The Twitter plugin for WordPress makes it easier to explicitly include Twitter features and functionality on your WordPress site. No additional tracking is added as a result of our plugin code's execution on your server(s).

Twitter widgets and buttons load Twitter's widgets.js library through the WordPress JavaScript queue. Read more about [how Twitter for Websites widgets respect user privacy](https://dev.twitter.com/web/overview/privacy).

Twitter advertising trackers are only included on the page when invoked by the site using the `twitter_tracking` shortcode. Read more about [Twitter's policies for conversion tracking and tailored audiences products](https://support.twitter.com/articles/20171365-policies-for-conversion-tracking-and-tailored-audiences).
